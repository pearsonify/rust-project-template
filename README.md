# Rust Project Template

This repository contains the basic template for new rust projects. Including a directory structure, lib.rs, and github actions.

## Github Actions

Many of these actions may be combined to reduce the number of checkouts required. But for the purposes of this repository, they are kept separate to allow for easy import of any specific action.
